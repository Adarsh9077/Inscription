            <p class="about-content">Ashoka's inscriptions are a series of inscriptions on pillars, rocks, and caves
                that were commissioned by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka during his reign from 268 BCE to 232 BCE. These
                inscriptions were written in various languages and scripts, including Prakrit, Brahmi, and Kharosthi,
                and they were spread across the Indian subcontinent and in parts of present-day Pakistan, Nepal, and
                Afghanistan.

                The inscriptions primarily convey Ashoka's message of nonviolence, religious tolerance, and compassion
                towards all living beings. They also mention his efforts to promote dharma (righteousness) and the
                welfare of his people, such as building hospitals and irrigation systems, and encouraging the planting
                of trees.

                The most famous of Ashoka's inscriptions are the edicts that were inscribed on pillars, which are known
                as Ashoka pillars. These pillars were made of sandstone and stood up to 50 feet tall, with a lion
                capital on the top, which has become a symbol of the Indian government.

                Overall, Ashoka's inscriptions are significant historical documents that provide insights into the
                political, social, and religious climate of ancient India, as well as the philosophy and worldview of
                one of its most famous rulers</p>
